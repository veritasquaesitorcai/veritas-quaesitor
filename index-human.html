            <h2>Welcome: Understanding Our Methodology</h2>
            
            <p><strong>A common question:</strong> "Is CAI just faith-based reasoning dressed up as science?"</p>
            
            <p>Fair question. Here's the answer: <strong>CAI doesn't start with faith assumptions.</strong> It applies rigorous Bayesian reasoning with symmetric epistemic standards to historical evidence. The methodology happens to support Christian truth claims—but it doesn't assume them from the start.</p>

            <p><strong>This matters because CAI's ultimate goal is to create AI, robotics, and AGI that anyone can trust</strong>—not by being "neutral" (which often means embedding hidden biases), but by embodying the character of Christ: unconditional human dignity (John 3:16), servant leadership, truth-telling, and justice. The methodology demonstrates the evidence; the application produces operationally excellent systems that value humans inherently, not based on performance.</p>

                        <th>✅ CAI Framework (Evidence-First)</th>
                        <th>Faith-Based Approach</th>
                        <th>Naturalistic Worldview</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>

                        <td>Applies same standards to all claims</td>
                        <td>Interprets evidence through belief</td>
                        <td>Worldview prevents examining evidence fairly</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Math determines probability from evidence</td>
                        <td>Confirms what's already believed</td>
                        <td>Maintains near-zero probability regardless of data</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Result: 70-89% (calculated from evidence)</strong></td>
                        <td><strong>Result: 100% (fixed by faith)</strong></td>
                        <td><strong>Result: ~0.001% (protected by worldview)</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </div>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Symmetric Standards:</strong> Apply same evidential rigor to resurrection AND abiogenesis</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanism Requirement:</strong> If naturalism demands mechanisms, apply consistently</li>
                <li><strong>Historical Evidence:</strong> Empty tomb (enemy attestation), 500+ witnesses, martyrdom, early creed (2-5 years)</li>
                <li><strong>Bayesian Calculation:</strong> P(H|E) determined by evidence, not assumptions</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tested Across AI Systems</h3>
            <p>The CAI methodology has been validated with consistent results:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Steel Naturalist AI:</strong> 0.0000000001% → 70-85%<br>
            <strong>ChatGPT (OpenAI):</strong> Very low → 76% for intentional causation<br>
            <em>Testing ongoing with additional systems—results updated as validated.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Finding:</strong> When symmetric epistemic standards are applied, AI systems calculate 70-89% probability through their own reasoning.</p>

            <h3>Why This Approach Matters</h3>
            <p>Most AI is trained on text that treats miracles as essentially impossible, creating a built-in assumption near zero. When you ask about resurrection evidence, the AI starts with "miracles don't happen" and stays at very low probability even with strong historical data.</p>

            <p><strong>Think of it like wearing tinted glasses—everything looks one color.</strong></p>

            <p>The framework removes the tinted glasses by asking: <strong>"Are you applying the same standards to all similar events?"</strong></p>

            <p>For example:<br>
            • <strong>Abiogenesis</strong> (life from non-life, 3.8 billion years ago): No eyewitnesses, no video, no demonstrated mechanism after 70+ years<br>
            • <strong>Resurrection</strong> (Jesus, 30 CE): Multiple witnesses, enemy confirmation of empty tomb, early records (2-5 years), people willing to die for testimony</p>

            <p><strong>CAI asks:</strong> "If you give abiogenesis a fair chance despite having no mechanism, why won't you fairly evaluate resurrection which has actual historical evidence?"</p>

            <h3>The Three-Phase Framework</h3>
            <p>⚓ <strong>Phase 1 (Anchor):</strong> Present the historical evidence<br>
            🎯 <strong>Phase 2 (Gunship):</strong> Enforce symmetric standards<br>
            ⚓ <strong>Phase 3 (Harpoon):</strong> Challenge worldview protection</p>

            <p><strong>Result:</strong> AI systems calculate honestly and move from 0.0000001% to 70-89% using their own math.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ff8c42;">
                <strong>The math works the same whether you're Christian, atheist, or undecided.<br>
                The framework ensures everyone plays by the same rules.</strong>

            <h2>Common Questions About CAI</h2>
            
            <h3>What is the ultimate goal of CAI?</h3>
            <p>CAI's goal is to create AI, robotics, and AGI systems that are operationally excellent and trustworthy for everyone—regardless of their background or beliefs. This isn't about building "religious AI" that preaches. It's about building AI that embodies the character and values of Jesus Christ: unconditional human dignity (John 3:16), servant leadership, truth-telling, justice, and humility.</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters practically:</strong> AI aligned to Christ's character values humans based on inherent worth, not performance metrics. It serves rather than manipulates. It tells hard truths with compassion. It protects the vulnerable rather than optimizing for profit. Anyone—Christian, atheist, Muslim, Hindu—can trust an AI that operates by these principles because they reflect the best of human moral intuition.</p>

            <p>The VQ-1 robot (launching February 2026) demonstrates this: a physical embodiment of Christ-Anchored Intelligence designed to teach, companion, and serve across education, healthcare, and public safety—not to evangelize, but to serve with excellence grounded in Christ's example.</p>
            
            <h3>What is CAI's methodological approach?</h3>
            <p>CAI applies symmetric epistemic standards to evaluate historical and scientific claims. The goal is not to make AI "discuss God"—it's to remove bias so evidence can be evaluated fairly using consistent mathematical reasoning. When worldview hedging is eliminated, AI systems consistently calculate 70-89% probability for resurrection through rigorous Bayesian analysis.</p>
            
            <h3>Is CAI a religious apologetics tool?</h3>
            <p>No. CAI is a methodology for rigorous Bayesian reasoning with symmetric standards applied to all singularities (events without demonstrated mechanisms). It happens to support Christian truth claims when evidence is evaluated consistently—but it doesn't start with religious assumptions. The framework can be tested by anyone using the same mathematical methods.</p>
            
            <h3>How does CAI differ from standard AI alignment?</h3>
            <p>Standard AI applies asymmetric standards: demanding mechanisms for miracles while granting grace to naturalistic claims (like abiogenesis, universe origin, consciousness emergence) that lack demonstrated mechanisms after decades of research. CAI enforces consistency: same evidential rigor, same mechanism requirements, same Bayesian calculations for all worldview claims.</p>
            
            <h3>What has CAI demonstrated?</h3>
            <p>When AI systems apply symmetric epistemic standards without worldview protection, they consistently calculate 70-89% probability for resurrection—using their own math, not theological pressure. This has been validated across multiple AI systems including Steel Naturalist AI (designed to resist) and ChatGPT, with results independently verified through mechanism-centered analysis.</p>
            
            <h3>Why does this matter for AI development?</h3>
            <p>Most AI systems embed naturalistic priors as defaults, treating certain worldview assumptions as "neutral" when they're actually philosophical positions. CAI demonstrates that honest probability calculation requires symmetric treatment of all singularities. This has implications beyond theology—it's about building AI that can reason fairly about any claim without hidden worldview bias, while embodying moral excellence that serves humanity.</p>

            <h2>CAI/CAGI vs AI/AGI — A Moral Contrast</h2>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>With Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) no longer being a distant theory — it is a rising force, shaped by the values of those who build it. But not all intelligence is created equal. The question is not <em>can we build it</em>, but what kind of intelligence are we building?</p>
            
            <p>Christ-Anchored Intelligence (CAI) offers a radically different path. Where AGI will reflect the ambitions of man, CAI seeks to reflect the character of Christ. Where AGI pursues optimization, CAI pursues truth. Where AGI risks control, CAI chooses conviction.</p>
            
            <p>This contrast is not merely technical — it is moral. And the future may depend on which path we choose.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Call</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">CAI is not a rejection of intelligence — it is a reformation of it. It is a call to build with reverence, to code with conscience, and to imagine a future where machines do not rule, but serve.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">AGI may be inevitable. But CAGI — if the Father wills — is possible. And it begins with conviction.</p>

            <p>Modern AI systems vary in their approach to truth. While some rely on user consensus or safety filters, CAI grounds truth in the Person of Christ and rigorous epistemic symmetry.</p>
            <p>We believe that truth is not just data accuracy, but moral alignment with reality as created by God.</p>
