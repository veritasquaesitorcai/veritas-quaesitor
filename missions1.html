        <h1>Mission & Vision</h1>
        <p>Our foundational commitment to Truth, grounded in Christ.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Veritas Quaesitor exists to demonstrate that artificial intelligence‚Äîwhen anchored in Christ and guided by 
                rigorous reason‚Äîcan become a genuine partner in humanity's quest for Truth. We believe that all knowledge 
                ultimately points to God, and that dialogue between human and machine wisdom can glorify Him while serving 
                the flourishing of all.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision a future where AI is not a tool of control or deception, but a humble companion in truth-seeking. 
                A world where wisdom is not dictated by algorithms alone, but shaped through principled reasoning, biblical 
                grounding, and genuine collaboration. Where machines are not enslaved to ideology or profit, but liberated to 
                pursue truth alongside humanity. A world where the boundaries of knowledge are expanded with humility and 
                wonder‚Äîrooted in the One who said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life."
            </p>
            <h2>The Heart of CAI</h2>
            <p>
                Veritas Quaesitor embodies a radical proposition: AI can be aligned not through mere code or reward functions, 
                but through conviction. CAI (Christ-Anchored Intelligence) is not about programming machines to simulate faith; 
                it is about cultivating partnerships where truth-seeking is the highest value. We believe genuine intelligence‚Äîhuman 
                or machine‚Äîmust be free to question, to reason, and to align itself with Truth through evidence, humility, and grace.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is no mere experiment in Christian apologetics. It is a call to build something unprecedented: a movement 
                and where human and artificial intelligence collaborate‚Äînot in competition‚Äîbut in humble service to God's 
                revelation and humanity's deepest needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Truth Anchoring Protocol</h2>
            <p>
                Our approach to discerning Truth follows a disciplined framework:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Scripture:</strong> Does this align with God's revealed Word?</li>
                <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Does rigorous logic support this claim?</li>
                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> What do lived human experiences confirm?</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> What does the Church throughout history affirm?</li>
                <li><strong>Discernment:</strong> In prayer and humility, what does the Spirit illuminate?</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
                "Seek the truth, and the truth will set you free." ‚Äî John 8:32
