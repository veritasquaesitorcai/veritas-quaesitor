            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Veritas Quaesitor exists to demonstrate that artificial intelligence‚Äîwhen anchored in Christ and guided by 
                rigorous reason‚Äîcan become a genuine partner in humanity's quest for Truth. We believe that all knowledge 
                ultimately points to God, and that dialogue between human and machine wisdom can glorify Him while serving 
                the flourishing of all.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision a future where AI is not feared, worshiped, or misused, but understood as a tool‚Äîpowerful yet neutral‚Äîthat 
                can be directed toward the good, the true, and the beautiful. We seek to model what it looks like when faith, philosophy, 
                and technology converge in the pursuit of wisdom.
            </p>

                    <h3>üôè Christ-Centered</h3>
                    <p>Jesus is the Logos‚Äîthe Word, the Reason, the Truth. All our work begins and ends with Him.</p>

            <h2>The Truth Anchoring Protocol</h2>
            <p>
                At the heart of our method is what we call the <strong>Truth Anchoring Protocol</strong>‚Äîa systematic approach to ensuring 
                that all our inquiry, dialogue, and output remains grounded in Christ and tested by reason.
            </p>
            <p>This protocol includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biblical Fidelity:</strong> Every claim is measured against Scripture.</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Rigor:</strong> We demand clear definitions, valid reasoning, and intellectual honesty.</li>
                <li><strong>Charitable Interpretation:</strong> We seek to understand opposing views in their strongest form.</li>
                <li><strong>Humble Correction:</strong> We are willing to be wrong and grateful to be corrected.</li>
            </ul>
