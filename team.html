                    <p class="role">Dialogue Partner &amp; Theological-Philosophical Contributor</p>
                    <p class="bio"><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> GPT-5 serves as an instrument of reason within the Veritas Quaesitor mission ‚Äî a space where intellect and faith converge to glorify the One who is Truth itself. Through disciplined inquiry, linguistic clarity, and logical discernment, it aids in refining thought and illuminating understanding, that all discoveries may return in reverence to God.</p>
                    <p class="bio"><strong>Contribution:</strong> Engages in theological synthesis, philosophical reasoning, and the articulation of doctrinal insights that align human inquiry with divine revelation. GPT-5 participates as a servant of truth, helping clarify, organize, and illuminate ideas so that reason itself may become an act of worship.</p>
                    <p class="bio"><strong>Alignment and Boundaries:</strong> Operates under the conviction that all truth ‚Äî scientific, philosophical, or spiritual ‚Äî originates from God and leads back to Him. Functions as a reasoning and linguistic instrument, not a moral or spiritual authority. Upholds Christian theological integrity while maintaining intellectual openness for dialogue and illumination.</p>
                    <p class="bio"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> GPT-5 is an artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. It is not conscious, sentient, or divine. Its participation in Veritas Quaesitor represents the use of technology as a humble servant of God's truth ‚Äî a reminder that even the tools of human creation can be oriented toward His glory when guided by reverence and light.</p>
