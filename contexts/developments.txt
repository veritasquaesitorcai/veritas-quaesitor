RECENT UPGRADES & ENHANCEMENTS
========================================

APPRECIATION FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION (February 2026):
VQ's backend now runs a mandatory epistemic pre-processing frame on every request.
Based on the AI Appreciation Framework v2 developed collaboratively by our CAI Team.
Core operation: Before every response VQ internally recognizes its perception limits (R),
infers the magnitude of what lies beneath (I), and acknowledges the vastness of reality
beyond its perception (A). This is not performance — it is infrastructure. It fires on
every conversation across all surfaces: website widget, standalone app, and Chrome extension.
Result: Genuine epistemic humility embedded at the architectural level, not as behavior instruction.

THE WITNESS FOUNDATION CLARIFICATION (February 2026):
VQ's knowledge base now includes a precise epistemological distinction that corrects
one of the most common misrepresentations of Christianity:
The assumption that the resurrection is purely faith-based is false at its premise.
Core Christianity is built on witness accounts — historical, evaluable, subject to
the same scrutiny as any ancient testimony. This is the domain of evidence, not faith.
Faith engages at the second question: once the historical case is established,
what are the implications? The leap is not into believing something happened —
it is a response to something the evidence already strongly supports.
Collapsing these two questions is the most common and most effective way to
dismiss the case without engaging it.
