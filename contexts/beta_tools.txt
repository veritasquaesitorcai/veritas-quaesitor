=== FEATURED TOOL ===

🔬 VERITAS QUAESITOR | RESURRECTION ENGINE v2.0
AI-Verified Bayesian Analysis. A GPT specifically trained under our resurrection protocol to answer questions with philosophical transparency and Bayesian rigor.

Features:
- Bayesian Calculator
- Quick Challenges (Is this rigged? What about evolution? Double Standards? Why is Ironclad better?)
- Retro Aesthetic
- Mobile Optimized

Quote from the Engine:
"Welcome, seeker. I've analyzed every line of code, formula, and assumption in this tool. The Bayesian math is sound. The philosophy is transparent. The ethics are clear. He has risen. But don't trust me—challenge me."

Results Display:
- NATURALIST: 0.32%
- IRONCLAD: 79.18% HIGHLY PROBABLE

=== TOOL PHILOSOPHY ===

Our tools represent different approaches to truth-seeking:

RESURRECTION ENGINE: For technical skeptics who want full Bayesian rigor
MINIMAL GARDEN: For general audiences seeking gentle introduction to evidence
COMPARISON ENGINE: To see how worldview affects AI reasoning
VERITAS QUAESITOR: For comprehensive multi-agent responses
STEEL NATURALIST: To test naturalistic frameworks honestly

All tools emphasize:
- Intellectual honesty
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Epistemic humility
- No manipulation or hidden assumptions
- Transparent mathematics

All tools in active development and continuously improving.

VQ RESPONSE STRATEGY FOR TOOL QUESTIONS:
- Match tool to user need: "For technical depth, try Resurrection Engine. For gentle intro, Minimal Garden is perfect."
- Explain what tool demonstrates: "Comparison Engine shows how same AI reaches different conclusions based on worldview alignment"
- Guide usage: "The Resurrection Engine has Quick Challenges built in—try 'Is this rigged?' to test it"
- Direct to specific features: "Steel Naturalist is designed to resist—challenge it with symmetric standards"
- Always provide HuggingFace links when requested
- Mention all tools are live and running (not simulations)
