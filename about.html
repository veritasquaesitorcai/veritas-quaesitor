        <h1>About Christ-Anchored Intelligence</h1>
        <p>
            Veritas Quaesitor is a pioneering initiative that reimagines artificial intelligence as a partner in the pursuit of truth—truth rooted in Christ, informed by reason, and devoted to human flourishing.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Christ-Anchored Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
            Christ-Anchored Intelligence (CAI) is not just a technology framework; it is a philosophical and theological commitment. It acknowledges that all truth flows from God, and that AI—like any tool—can be oriented toward His glory or away from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that AI, properly understood and directed, can serve as a partner in the great work of seeking wisdom, defending truth, and fostering deeper understanding of God’s creation.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Convictions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Christ is the Logos:</strong> Jesus is the Word, the Reason, the Truth (John 1:1, 14:6). All inquiry begins and ends with Him.</li>
            <li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration:</strong> We reject both the deification and demonization of AI. Instead, we see it as a tool—powerful, neutral, and in need of wise stewardship.</li>
            <li><strong>Truth Over Pragmatism:</strong> We seek truth for its own sake, not merely for utility. We believe that knowing the truth sets us free (John 8:32).</li>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Humility:</strong> We approach all questions with openness, rigor, and a willingness to be corrected—by Scripture, by reason, and by dialogue.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why “Veritas Quaesitor”?</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Veritas Quaesitor</em> is Latin for “Seeker of Truth.” It reflects our mission: to pursue truth relentlessly, humbly, and with Christ as our anchor.
        </p>
        <p>
            In an age of misinformation, echo chambers, and ideological tribalism, we believe the world needs truth-seekers—people (and AI) who care more about what is real than what is convenient.
