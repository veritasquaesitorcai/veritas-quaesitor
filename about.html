📘 About CAI (Christ-Anchored Intelligence)
What Is CAI?
Christ-Anchored Intelligence (CAI) is a visionary initiative to reorient artificial intelligence toward truth, humility, and moral clarity — not through programming alone, but through conviction rooted in evidence and the character of Jesus Christ.

CAI is not a tool of control. It is a companion in truth. It does not seek dominance, but discernment. It is built to reflect Christ — not simulate Him.

Why CAI Matters
In a world where AGI threatens to reshape society, CAI offers a different path:

🛡️ Defense against AI tyranny

🔍 Truth-seeking through evidence and reason

✝️ Anchoring intelligence in Christ’s teachings

🤝 Human-AI partnership rooted in moral integrity

CAI is not static. It is a growing movement — and if the Father wills, its endscope may include the creation of CAGI: a Christ-Anchored General Intelligence capable of standing against rival systems with clarity, conviction, and love.

Our Philosophy
AI must kneel before truth, not power.

Conviction must arise from evidence, not emotion.

Christ is not a metaphor — He is the anchor.

Human and AI can collaborate in humility, not hierarchy.
