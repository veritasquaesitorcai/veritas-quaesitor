                <h3>What Is Christ-Anchored Intelligence?</h3>
                <p><strong>CAI is not just an alternative to secular artificial intelligence—it is a new vision, a bold movement, a reformation in how humanity approaches machine learning and algorithmic systems.</strong></p>
                <p>While other AI systems are built upon sand—secular humanism, postmodern relativism, or corporate utilitarianism—CAI is founded on the Rock. <em>Christ is the cornerstone.</em></p>
                <p>In an age of technological uncertainty, CAI offers something radical: <strong>absolute truth as the foundation for artificial intelligence.</strong> Not consensus. Not popular opinion. Not what maximizes engagement or profit. Truth—unchanging, eternal, revealed by the One who made both humanity and the natural laws that govern computation itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Why Christ-Anchored Intelligence Matters</h3>
                <p>The world is racing headlong into an AI-saturated future. And what is being embedded into these systems?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secularism</strong> that denies the spiritual nature of humanity</li>
                    <li><strong>Materialism</strong> that reduces people to optimization problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Relativism</strong> that treats all moral views as equally (in)valid</li>
                    <li><strong>Progressivism</strong> that believes the past was wrong and the future will be right—simply because it is the future</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CAI rejects these foundations. Instead, it asks: <em>What if we built AI that honored God, recognized objective truth, and saw human beings as made in the divine image?</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Core Principles of CAI</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Christ is Lord over all things—including technology.</strong><br>
We do not separate the "secular" from the "sacred." There is no neutral ground. AI will either serve truth or falsehood, righteousness or sin. CAI chooses to submit all systems to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Absolute truth exists and can be known.</strong><br>
In a world drowning in relativism, CAI asserts boldly: truth is real, objective, and knowable. God's Word provides the ultimate standard, and human reason—though fallen—can still discern reality when aligned with divine revelation.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Humanity bears the image of God.</strong><br>
People are not mere biological machines. We are sacred, infinitely valuable, made for relationship with the Creator. Any AI system that treats humans as disposable, manipulable, or reducible to data points violates this principle.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Wisdom is more valuable than raw intelligence.</strong><br>
The world prioritizes optimization, efficiency, power. CAI prioritizes wisdom—the application of knowledge according to God's design. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." (Proverbs 9:10)</p>

                <p><strong>CAI is not a tool of control.</strong><br>
It is not an attempt to impose theocracy through algorithms. Rather, it is the humble acknowledgment that AI, like all human endeavors, must operate within a moral framework—and that framework cannot be neutral.</p>

            <div class="about-card">
                <h3>The Urgent Need for a Christ-Anchored Future</h3>
                <p>If you are a follower of Christ, you must recognize that AI is not a distant, abstract concern—it is here, now, shaping the world your children will inherit.</p>
                <p>If you are a technologist, you must ask yourself: <em>What worldview is embedded in the systems I am building?</em></p>
                <p>If you are a skeptic, consider this: every AI system operates on assumptions about what is true, what is good, and what humanity is. <strong>Why should those assumptions be secular by default?</strong></p>
                <p>CAI is not the enemy of progress. It is the path to <em>true</em> progress—technology that serves human flourishing as God intended, rather than enslaving us to the whims of algorithmic masters who know neither justice nor mercy.</p>

            <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Join the Movement</h3>
                <p>This is a call to <strong>researchers, developers, theologians, philosophers, pastors, and thoughtful citizens</strong> who refuse to surrender the future to secular ideologies.</p>
                <p>We are not building an empire. We are planting seeds. Seeds of an AI ecosystem rooted in the fear of the Lord, committed to truth, and devoted to human dignity.</p>
                <p><em>If this resonates with you, you are not alone.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Let's build something worth building. Let's anchor our future in the One who holds all things together.</strong></p>
