                <h3>What We Believe</h3>
                <p>Christ-Anchored Intelligence (CAI) represents a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence development—one that acknowledges the existence of absolute truth and recognizes the transcendent dignity of human beings created in the image of God.</p>
                <p>In an era where AI systems are increasingly trained on purely secular, relativistic worldviews, CAI offers an alternative: technology development anchored in timeless wisdom and biblical truth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>CAI isn't about creating "Christian AI" in a narrow sectarian sense. Rather, it's about developing artificial intelligence that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognizes objective moral truth rather than pure relativism</li>
                    <li>Upholds human dignity as foundational, not negotiable</li>
                    <li>Acknowledges the limits of technological solutions to human problems</li>
                    <li>Pursues wisdom alongside knowledge and power</li>
                    <li>Embraces transparency, accountability, and humility</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>The artificial intelligence systems being developed today will shape human civilization for generations to come. The values, assumptions, and worldviews embedded in these systems matter tremendously.</p>
                <p>If AI development proceeds exclusively from secular materialist premises, we risk creating powerful technologies that treat human beings as merely complex biological machines, moral questions as matters of preference, and truth itself as a social construct.</p>
                <p>CAI proposes a different foundation—one that has sustained human flourishing for millennia and can guide us toward a more humane technological future.</p>

                <h3>Get Involved</h3>
                <p>This project is in its earliest stages, and we're seeking collaborators, researchers, and thoughtful critics who share our conviction that AI development needs a firmer philosophical and theological foundation.</p>
                <p>Whether you're a developer, theologian, ethicist, or simply someone concerned about the future of technology, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
